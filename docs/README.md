## Maintenance

This documentation is maintained alongside the codebase. When contributing:
1. Update the appropriate level guide for any changes
2. Add examples for new features in relevant guides
3. Keep the User Guide simple and the Developer Guide comprehensive
4. Archive detailed technical docs that don't fit the level structure
